1,"Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving
by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies
to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it
brings a curious consequence with it.","walt whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between ""loving by allowance"" and ""loving with personal love."" this distinction applies to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it brings a curious consequence with it.",322,318,,

Abbey, its completeness, finish, and entrain, obscure the undoubted
critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with
difficulty. Persuasion, relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite
delicacy and keeping.","to some the delightful freshness and humour of northanger abbey, its completeness, finish, and entrain, obscure the undoubted critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with difficulty. persuasion, relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite delicacy and keeping.",443,437,,
5,"The catastrophe of Mansfield Park is admittedly
theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost
wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that
Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might
very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;
yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and
others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it. Sense and
Sensibility has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
not want them._

_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes
would, all things considered, be divided between Emma and the present
book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss
Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge
of vulgarity) would go for Emma.","the catastrophe of mansfield park is admittedly theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that edmund only took fanny because mary shocked him, and that fanny might very likely have taken crawford if he had been a little more assiduous; yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of mrs. norris and others have secured, i believe, a considerable party for it. sense and sensibility has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does not want them. i suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes would, all things considered, be divided between emma and the present book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for miss austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge of vulgarity) would go for emma.",890,875,,

_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the
reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,
when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and
finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till
1813, only four years before her death.","it seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most eminently quintessential of its author's works; and for this contention in such narrow space as is permitted to me, i propose here to show because. in the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796, when miss austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and finished at chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till 1813, only four years before her death.",548,539,,

14,"Although Miss Austen
always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her
opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to
be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly
natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given
by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from
the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive
aversion to actual love.","although miss austen always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly natural occasions provided by the false account of darcy's conduct given by wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from the gradual transformation of elizabeth's own feelings from positive aversion to actual love.",481,474,,

ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one
should put Pride and Prejudice far lower if it did not contain what
seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her
faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John
Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,

superior to them._

27,"A man in the early eighteenth century,
of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early
nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,

innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play
at blind-man’s-buff.","a man in the early eighteenth century, of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early nineteenth; and no doubt miss austen's principles, as well as her heart, would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate husband in the spectator, who describes, with all the gusto and all the innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play at blind-man's-buff.",419,413,,

her son.","but another spectator letter--that of the damsel of fourteen who wishes to marry mr. shapely, and assures her selected mentor that ""he admires your spectators mightily""--might have been written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent lydia bennet in the days of lydia's great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (i think unreasonably) have found ""cynicism"" in touches of miss austen's own, such as her satire of mrs. musgrove's self-deceiving regrets over her son.",485,478,,
